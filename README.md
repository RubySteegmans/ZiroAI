# ZiroAI
All the work I have done on my internship in SA for ZiroPay

There's 4 folders here:
- Flutter app is the test app I made in flutter. It holds the code which takes a camera input, runs the OCR model on it for a transcription and then sends that transcription to an endpoint.
- Reseach holds the mess that is all of the code I've written
- Split-the-bill contains most importantly a dataset of 64 annotated receipts from various store and some attempted training code
- ZiroAI is the most important folder, it holds the full deployment of the chatbot. See documentation.
